# Known issues

Since some websites could be served as XML with a XHTML-namespace, it will also attach itself to plain XML-files and will be rendered in the top of the XML. This might confuse you if you look at XML-files in the browser, as the complete injected script is in the DOM of the XML. I haven't found a way to hide it from real XML-files, but still support it for XHTML-namespaces.
